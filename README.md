# Postulate.Orm.MySql

These are some baby steps towards implementing Postulate.Orm for MySQL. At this point, basic Crud operations work.

[Schema Merge](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Postulate.Orm/wiki/Schema-Merge) does not, however, since I did that feature with SQL Server in mind, and the feature is not properly virtualized for other database vendors. I would like to get to that, but we'll see!
